This project is a basic "hello world" type example of using the drools rules engine in a boot application.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Basically a simple application that loads rules files (.drl) from the classpath, and runs a simple evaluation of a rule against a couple of objects of type Applicant.  The rule sets the 'valid' property to true if the age is less than 18.

The app simply prints to the console the before and after state of the objects.
