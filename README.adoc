This project is a basic "hello world" type example of using the drools rules engine in a boot application.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Basically a simple application that loads rules files (.drl) from the classpath, and runs a simple evaluation of a rule against a couple of objects of type `Applicant`.  The rule sets the `valid` property to `true` if the age is less than 18.

The app simply prints to the console the state of these objects both before and after the rule is applied.
